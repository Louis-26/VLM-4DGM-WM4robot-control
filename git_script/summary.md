## pull between branch, from one remote branch to another local branch(replace local files by remote files with the same name)

`git_pull_between_branch.sh`

## pull request, from one remote branch to another remote branch(pull request record on github)

`git_pull_request.sh`

## remove large files or folders from remote repository

## restore from a lfs repo to a normal git repo
We usually run this script after running `git_lfs_remove.sh` to completely remove lfs tracking from a repository.
`git_migrate.sh`

## verify that lfs files have been removed from remote repository
`git_lfs_remove_verify_final.sh`
`git_lfs_remove_verify_lf_orphaned.sh`

## copy repository from one owner to another owner(or another repo name)
`git_copy.sh`

# linux machine change permission

in linux, add `chmod -R +x git_script` for a folder, or `chmod +x git_script/git_push.sh` for a single file, to make it
executable.

# other command

in linux, convert dos to unix: `sed -i 's/\r$//' FILE_NAME`, e.g., `sed -i 's/\r$//' git_script/git_push.sh`

if you meet fatal error on divergent branches when pulling,
use `git config pull.rebase false`
