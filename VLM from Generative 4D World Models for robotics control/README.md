Generative 4D World Models: Bridging VLMs and High-Fidelity Spatial-Temporal Splatting for Adaptive Robot Control



## key word

VLM, World Models, Robotics, 3D/4D visual generative models, physical scene understanding



* tools: VLM
* environment: 3D physical scene
* model: world model, generative model
* object: robot/agent



## research question

**VLM** gives the command, trained by the **world model**, rendered by the 4D generative model, and then controls/trains the **robot** in 3D world
